This thesis evaluates the feasibility and effectiveness of integrating free-list based allocators within ZGC to enhance memory compaction processes and reduce fragmentation. By implementing and benchmarking two distinct allocators, the TLSF and Buddy systems, against the conventional bump-pointer method used by ZGC, this study aims to provide a comparative analysis focusing on key performance metrics including allocation throughput, fragmentation levels, and overall efficiency.

The research examines the trade-offs involved when incorporating free-list allocators into ZGC, such as potential increases in computational overhead and complexity in the allocation process. These factors are quantitatively assessed to offer a balanced perspective on both the advantages and possible drawbacks of this integration.

Furthermore, this thesis explores the broader practical implications and potential applications of free-list based allocators within ZGC and possibly other garbage collectors. Insights gained from this study are expected to guide future research directions, particularly in refining garbage collection techniques and optimizing memory management strategies in Java Virtual Machines.
